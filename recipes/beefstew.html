        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a hearty beef and root vegetable stew recipe. It's sure to please the whole family on cold, winter nights. We use a brown beer and brown sugar,
            which gives the stew that signature beer tang, while the sugar mellows any bitterness from the beer.
        </p>
        <p>This recipe is perfect for
            the crock pot, which renders the meat tender and juicy after 8 hours of cooking. While this is mostly a hands-off cooking process, 
            the carrots and potatoes are added later, to prevent them from becoming mushy. </p>
